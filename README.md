# Functionality Description

## 1. Basic Chat Functionality:

* Users can type questions and interact with AI in real-time.
* Questions are sent to the backend via the askQuestion function, which also updates the conversation history.
* Responses from the AI are streamed back to the frontend in chunks for real-time experience.


## 2. Code Snippet Display
* Added a CodeBlock component to display and copy code snippets easily.
* Each code block includes a "Copy" button for convenience.

## 3. Real-Time Response Streaming
* AI-generated responses are streamed back in chunks, allowing users to see responses as they are generated, reducing wait times.
## 4. File Upload Support
* Users can upload files (plain text, CSV, JSON, or PDF) as part of their query.
* The system validates file type and size (up to 20 MB) and notifies users of errors instantly.

## 5. Voice Chat Integration
* Users can interact with the platform using speech recognition and text-to-speech (TTS) features.
* The browserâ€™s SpeechSynthesis API is used for TTS to read AI responses aloud.
* Includes a toggle to enable/disable TTS for hands-free interaction.

## 6. Secure User Authentication
* Provides secure user registration and login functionality.
* User credentials are hashed with bcrypt and stored in MongoDB.
* JWT-based session management ensures secure communication.
* Tokens are set to expire after 3 hours to balance security and usability.
## 7. Chat History Preservation
* User conversations are saved to a database for future reference.
* Authenticated users can retrieve and view their chat history.
* Access control ensures that only authorized users can access their data, maintaining privacy.
